# Unicorn Light - UI Theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/)

A retro theme for [Atom](https://atom.io) that matches the [unicorn syntax](https://atom.io/packages/unicorn-light-syntax).
Featuring custom icons in the sidebar, thin and sleek minimal tabs, and a color scheme akin to solarize light.

This theme can then be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
